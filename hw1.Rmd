## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

rm(list = ls(all=TRUE ))
library(png)
library(animation)

rawData=read.csv('hw1.csv',header =TRUE)

allLine=length(rawData[,1])
rawData=rawData[-allLine,]

yearid=rawData[,1]

for (yid in c(1:length(rawData[,1])))
{
  barplot(as.matrix(rawData[yid,c(-1)]),  
          main = paste0("NTU Student Counseling Center Counseling People/Visits
 "," in ",rawData[yid,1]))
}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
